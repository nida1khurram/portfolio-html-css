        <p className="about-p">
        Hello! I&#39;m Nida, a passionate Frontend Web Developer with a knack for crafting intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. With a solid background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and modern frontend frameworks like Next.js, I strive to create seamless and responsive web experiences.
        </p>
  
  <p className="about-p">
  My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how websites were built and evolved into a full-blown passion for bringing designs to life on the web. I believe that the best web applications are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, and I work meticulously to achieve that balance in every project.
  </p>
 <p className="about-p"> I have honed my skills in various aspects of frontend development, including:
 Responsive Design: Ensuring that websites look great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.</p>
  <p className="about-p">Performance Optimization: Crafting efficient code to enhance load times and user experience.
  Cross-Browser Compatibility: Making sure that all users have a consistent experience, regardless of their browser.</p>
  <p className="about-p">UI/UX Design: Collaborating with designers to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
  I am always excited to learn new technologies and keep up with industry trends. When I&#39;m not coding, you can find me exploring new places, experimenting with new recipes, or catching up on the latest in tech and design.</p>

  Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the possibility of working with you and bringing your ideas to life!
